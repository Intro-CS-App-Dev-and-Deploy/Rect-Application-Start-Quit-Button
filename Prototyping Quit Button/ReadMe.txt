Note: app groups code once that group is working

Note: app will not work if not in landscape


Steps that work
- Prototype Quit Button in KeyPressed without Canvas, compare to OS Quit Button
- create rect()
- review display orientation before fully populating rectangle
- review how the program breaks if not in landscape mode
- make hoverover feature work
- explain mouseX&Y variables visually, as the conditional in the IF statement, and as the middle values in the println()
- copy the conditional to the mousePressed(){} and review any button on the mouse will work
  - note: explore Processing.org/reference to learn how to code other parts of the mouse

Finally, review how subprograms work
- CAUTION: subprograms are a CS20 skill
- Double CAUTION: passing parameters (the local variables for center of the screen) 
    is firmly a CS20 skill
